A life in three paragraphs
=========

Enjoying the visuals of life I was always drawn to creative pursuits. During my childhood I made my own comics (harassing my brother to give me character ideas to bring to life). My teen years attracted to media, I still dabbled with drawing and art, but my sights were now on motion. I shot mini films in my free time (I'll save myself the embarrassment by not including links here) and went to university to create cool things with others who loved filming. Though, I soon fell out of love with the "take-all, give-little back" culture that enveloped the media industry. A strong urge to give had grown inside me.

This, naturally brought me to care. I could enrich people's day-to-day while learning about the human condition. This was fun, I got to meet a ton of people and when in a supervisor role I could use my management skills I'd gained during university. I trained in dementia care, learning disabilities and spinal injuries. I still wanted more. Helping one was good, but helping more at once seemed to be the answer. I turned to technology.

Now, I was a modern day cave-person with a fearful fascination of digital magic. I could use the basics of Facebook. The spark of understanding technology hit me out of nowhere and I enjoy the being a testament that if I can learn software, anyone can. I adore the culture! A horde of people wanting to make something from nothing and enhance life around them? Yes please, thank you very much! It seems to be the opposite of all that I had experienced previously. I built little projects at first, teaching myself all that I could, when I decided to work on turning this hobby into my future I was honoured to be offered a fellowship spot at Maker's. I have recently graduated and currently have the role of assistant coach.

Soft-Skills
===========

## Efficient Communicator ##

  Determined to understand and compassionate with explanations. A combination of these helps me to approach learning from both angles; obtaining knowledge and passing it on effectively.

## Inquisitive and Imaginative ##

  Deciding to understand how technology works has been one of the best choices I have ever made. Uniting that with my natural creativity has opened a door to allow me to make what I think of.

**Makers Academy - Assistant Coach (November 2018 - Present)**

After completing the course I was offered this role. My responsibilities are to help current students with their process and help to unblock and to perform code reviews, giving students positive and constructive feedback. I love to see all forms the projects can take in different people's hands. I mostly enjoy the challenge of refactoring others code to be able to provide solid feedback on how to improve.

**Active Assistance (July 2014 - August 2018)**

Specialty care of patients with cerebral palsy and spinal injuries.
I first started to get into software development when I was with my cerebral palsy client. I wanted to make games that encouraged movement, exercise of his hand and active involvement with an activity. I started off with basic games to tap and cause reactions on screen. Matcher games and animations with sound.

When working with my spinal client with a C4 injury I had the honour of learning more about voice activation software, could see first hand the independence it brought back to someone's life after such a tragedy. Understanding functions allowed me to explain accurately why certain commands did not work, re-training this client to speak to the computer as a machine, rather than naturally speak which you would have with another person.

**Community carer & Field Care Supervisor (November 2011 - Jan 2014)**

During these years I worked with Dementia patients and the elderly. I wanted to help others so this role was a natural go to for me, I got the chance to learn about their lives and contributed to raising their quality of life.

After some time I took on the role of Field Care Supervisor. Alongside caring for my own set of clients I held the on-call phone used for emergencies, assisting other carers with issues and liaised with clients. I managed the rotas, held introductions for new clients, updated safety reports and trained new staff.

**Runaway Media (August 2011 - November 2011)**

Upon finishing University a couple of my peers and I teamed up with our lecturer who had just retired. We founded the company, we wanted to provide affordable media services to not-for-profit organisations. We discussed with the clients what they wanted, worked with a budget and delivered products for the clients to use on their websites, as part of training and part of presentations.

[Education](#ed)
=========

**Maker's Academy (August 2018 - November 2018)**

A 12 week software bootcamp. While here I learnt and worked with:

- Agile development, XP values and git flow.
- TDD process, OOD principles, MVC
- Languages used during here all mentioned above.
- Team work and software improvement through peer and coach code reviews.

**Self-Study: Software Development (2016 - continuous)**

I started as a hobbyist learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. Tools I used were:

  - Udemy, Treehouse, Freecodecamp, Books, Articles.

**University of Bedfordshire - Television Production (BA(Hons), 2.1) (2008 - 2011)**

On reflection this wasn't so different to software development. To create a finished project we'd follow the process of planning stage, setup, deployment. Planning was storyboarding, recce areas, create scripts for both team and machines. Setup - lighting, cameras and director's gallery. Deployment - editing and formatting for different uses.

Roles I carried out during this time:

- During the first half of the course I favoured editing, set design and lighting. I loved the behind the scenes work. I dabbled with camera work, usually on-site in studio.

- Second half I mainly fell into the roles of Project Management. Making sure the schedule ran, gathered volunteers, oversaw team co-operation, kept communication open when issues arose, liaised with clients, recced areas and handled budget.
