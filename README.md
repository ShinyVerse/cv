Started off as a hobbyist while I cared for spinal injury patients, as my interest grew I began building more projects, Javascript being my area of interest. I have recently graduated from Maker's Academy, a 12 week software bootcamp.

Soft-Skills
===========

## Efficient Communicator ##

  Determined to understand and compassionate with explanations. A combination of these helps me to approach learning from both angles; obtaining knowledge and passing it on effectively.

## Inquisitive and Imaginative ##

  Deciding to understand how technology works has been one of the best choices I have ever made. Uniting that with my natural creativity has opened a door to allow me to make what I think of.
