I am an enthusiastic self-taught Front-End Developer, currently a student at Maker's Academy, a 16 week software bootcamp, with aspirations to acquire a full stack skill set.

To aid my visual learning I read related books and articles and approach the topics practically with building my own projects to help cement my understandings.

# Soft-Skills #

## Efficient Communicator ##

Determined to understand and compassionate with explanations. A combination of these helps me to approach learning from both angles; obtaining knowledge and passing it on effectively.

## Inquisitive and Imaginative ##

Deciding to discover how technology works has been one of the greatest choices I ever made. Uniting that with my natural creativity has brought a new sense of richness to my day to day.
