Started off as a hobbyist while I cared for spinal injury patients, as my interest grew I began building more projects, Javascript being my area of interest. I have recently graduated from Maker's Academy, a 12 week software bootcamp.

Soft-Skills
===========

## Efficient Communicator ##

  Determined to understand and compassionate with explanations. A combination of these helps me to approach learning from both angles; obtaining knowledge and passing it on effectively.

## Inquisitive and Imaginative ##

  Deciding to understand how technology works has been one of the best choices I have ever made. Uniting that with my natural creativity has opened a door to allow me to make what I think of.

Background
=========
**Makers Academy - Assistant Coach (November 2018 - Present)**

After completing the course I was offered this role. My responsibilities are to help current students with their process and help to unblock and to perform code reviews, giving students positive and constructive feedback. I love to see all forms the projects can take in different people's hands. I mostly enjoy the challenge of refactoring others code to be able to provide solid feedback on how to improve.

**Active Assistance (July 2014 - August 2018)**

Specialty care of patients with cerebral palsy and spinal injuries.
I first started to get into software development when I was with my cerebral palsy client. I wanted to make games that encouraged movement, exercise of his hand and active involvement with an activity. I started off with basic games to tap and cause reactions on screen. Matcher games and animations with sound.

When working with my spinal client with a C4 injury I had the honour of learning more about voice activation software, could see first hand the independence it brought back to someone's life after such a tragedy. Understanding functions allowed me to explain accurately why certain commands did not work, re-training this client to speak to the computer as a machine, rather than naturally speak which you would have with another person.

**Community carer & Field Care Supervisor (November 2011 - Jan 2014)**

During these years I worked with Dementia patients and the elderly. I wanted to help others so this role was a natural go to for me, I got the chance to learn about their lives and contributed to raising their quality of life.

After some time I took on the role of Field Care Supervisor. Alongside caring for my own set of clients I held the on-call phone used for emergencies, assisting other carers with issues and liaised with clients. I managed the rotas, held introductions for new clients, updated safety reports and trained new staff.

**Runaway Media (August 2011 - November 2011)**

Upon finishing University a couple of my peers and I teamed up with our lecturer who had just retired. We founded the company, we wanted to provide affordable media services to not-for-profit organisations. We discussed with the clients what they wanted, worked with a budget and delivered products for the clients to use on their websites, as part of training and part of presentations.
